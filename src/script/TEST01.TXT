Hola this is the test! Hello, I am a test file.

There will be maximum of 2 lines per quotation. This is
an example of 2 of them.
Therefore, the script will always have an even number
of lines, I suppose?
Does that make sense?

I mean, sure.

So this is why we need a script compiler. And Janet might do a
good job of it.
